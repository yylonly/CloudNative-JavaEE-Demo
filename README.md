# Cloud native Application Development with Java EE

Businesses today are evolving so rapidly and supporting their expansion is not feasible. Many organizations have already have begun resorting to the elasticity of the cloud  as it offers them greater agility, resilience, and portability across clouds. This video course will be one stop for developers to understand the challenges faced to know how to build applications that are native to the cloud.

This course will be your guide to cloud native applications being built using the Java EE 8 and some additional well known open source components and APIs. In combination, these APIs enable you to easily build lightweight, loosely coupled, elastic, observable and secure microservices. Throughout this course we will address the different challenges you need to master to build truly cloud native applications with Java EE.

By the end of this course you are equipped with enough knowledge and practical experience to get your next cloud native Java EE microservices up and running in no time with ease.

## What will you learn

This course is packed with step-by-step instructions and realistic examples that are directly applicable in practice. The different sections of this course will focus on the important topics and challenges of cloud native application development such as communication, resiliency, state handling or observability and how these can be addresses using the latest Java EE 8 APIs.

1.	Design and build cloud native applications using Java EE 8.
2.	Deploy and run Java EE 8 microservices using Docker and Kubernetes
3.	Build robust and easily consumable REST APIs with JAX-RS and MicroProfile Open API
4.	Build resilient service clients using Hystrix and MicroProfile Fault Tolerance APIs
5.	Develop loosely coupled, message-driven microservices with JMS and JSON-P / JSON-B
6.	Implement configurability with DeltaSpike and MicroProfile Configuration
7.	Add and implement service monitoring with Metrics and MicroProfile Health
8.	Add and implement service tracing with MicroProfile OpenTracing and Jaeger
9.	Securing your microservices with JSON Web Tokens
